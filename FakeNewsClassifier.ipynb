            "[['Italy resists EU push for Russia sanctions over Aleppo bombings'\n",
            "  ' European Union leaders condemned Russia on Friday for its bombing of civilians in Syria’s besieged city of Aleppo but faced resistance from Italy to impose new sanctions against Moscow over the atrocities. Horrified by Russian air strikes on hospitals and an aid convoy that have killed hundreds of civilians including children, Britain, France and Germany want maximum pressure on Moscow to stop its assault on rebels in eastern Aleppo. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has broad trade ties with Russia, said economic sanctions should not be part of that strategy because they would not force Moscow to negotiate a peace settlement. ”We should do everything possible for a peace deal in Syria but it’s difficult to imagine that this should be linked to further sanctions on Russia,” Renzi told reporters after a   dinner in Brussels where the bloc discussed strategy. With no military role in the Syrian civil war, the European Union is relying on its neutral status to help the United Nations to end the near     Syrian conflict, anxious to be seen to be active.  France has sought to isolate Russia diplomatically, first  at the United Nations Security Council in New York with a failed bid to force a ceasefire and then with a formal condemnation by all 28 EU foreign ministers this week of Russia’s strikes in   eastern Aleppo.  European leaders followed up with equally strong language in their summit statement in the early hours of Friday. But the final version removed wording seen by Reuters in earlier drafts threatening sanctions on Russian individuals and companies linked to Syrian President Bashar  .  ”ALL OPTIONS” Russia’s intervention in the Syria conflict a year ago has turned the tide of the war in Assad’s favor. The recapture of Aleppo, Syria’s biggest city before the war, is now Moscow’s goal, seemingly at any cost, diplomats said. French President Francois Hollande, who held   talks on Wednesday in Berlin with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, insisted that sanctions had not been completely ruled out. ”All the options are open as long as the truce is not respected and as long as there is a will to crush a city,” Hollande said of Aleppo, where some 275, 000 people are trapped and hundreds of people have been killed since a ceasefire agreed by Moscow and Washington broke down. Russia has told the United Nations it will stop bombing eastern Aleppo for 11 hours a day for four days, an announcement that EU officials speculated was timed to coincide with the EU summit in Brussels and as momentum was building to impose more crippling sanctions on the Kremlin. As the EU leaders discussed their options over dinner, a fleet of Russian warships carrying fighter bombers made its way along Europe’s western coast towards Syria. It is a naval operation that NATO believes is likely to intensify the assault on Aleppo, despite the Russian ceasefire pledge.  NATO   Jens Stoltenberg said he was seriously concerned about the fleet, saying: ”This may be used to increase attacks on Aleppo . .. to increase human suffering,” Stoltenberg told reporters.   Merkel who earlier denounced the air strikes on Aleppo as ”completely inhuman” said that she would do all she could to extend the ceasefire. She also said sanctions were still an option. ”If the intensity of the bombing that we’ve seen in recent days continues, then that would be a reason for us to think about what we do next,” she told Reuters.  UKRAINE TROUBLES Russia, with a weak rouble and an economy in recession, is feeling the impact of European Union and U. S. sanctions on the country’s financial, energy and defense sectors imposed over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in Ukraine. More sanctions on Russia would be unlikely to have much of an economic hit but could further worsen ties with Moscow. Highlighting those tensions, European Council President Donald Tusk, who chaired the summit, accused Russia of trying to weaken the European Union, saying leaders were worried about Russian hostilities ranging from airspace violations to disinformation campaigns and cyber attacks. ”Given these examples, it is clear that Russia’s strategy is to weaken the EU,” he said. Adding to the EU’s problems in the region, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told leaders at the end of the dinner that he was not optimistic of reaching a deal over a partnership agreement between the European Union and Ukraine, which was rejected by Dutch voters in a referendum in April. Western efforts to pull the former Soviet nation out of Moscow’s grasp with the   deal have been complicated by the Dutch vote. ”On the one hand a Dutch ’no’ could potentially have an effect on the region, on the other hand I do not want the Dutch voter to feel cheated,” Rutte told a press briefing in Brussels. Rutte added he would continue to negotiate behind the scenes to get an agreement in the Dutch parliament, as well as with Ukrainian and European leaders.

            " ['Police defend use water cannons on Dakota Access protesters in freezing weather'\n",
            "  '         Authorities on Monday defended their decision to douse protesters with water during a skirmish in subfreezing weather near the Dakota Access oil pipeline, and organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital  —   including some who were treated for hypothermia. Protesters trying to push past a   bridge on a state highway late Sunday and early Monday were turned back by authorities using tear gas, rubber bullets and water hoses. Tensions over the Dakota Access oil pipeline flared again Sunday when North Dakota law enforcement used water cannons to disperse a group of about 400 protesters trying to move past a barricaded bridge toward construction sites for the project. As temperatures in Cannon Ball, N. D. dropped into the 20s, police in riot gear sprayed activists with a hose mounted atop an armored vehicle and formed a line to prevent them from advancing up the road, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Protesters also reported being pelted with rubber bullets, tear gas and concussion grenades during the standoff, which lasted until late Sunday night. A grainy Facebook Live video from the scene shows throngs of people gathered around the Backwater Bridge on Highway 1806, with floodlights shining down on the grass and road below and a haze of smoke and water vapor rising near police vehicles. The clashes began around 6 p. m. when protesters tried to remove   trucks that had been blocking the bridge since authorities and activists faced off there in late October. Police have since set up wire and concrete barriers on the bridge, which is about a mile south of where the pipeline developer plans to drill. Protesters, who call themselves “water protectors,” have argued that the barricade prevents emergency services from reaching the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and a nearby camp they have used as a staging ground for demonstrations.      The protest of an oil pipeline that is being constructed close to the Standing Rock Indian reservation has become a rallying point for Native Americans across the United States. Here’s what you need to know. (Daron   Washington Post)   Authorities responded after protesters moved one of the trucks blocking the roadway. The Morton County Sheriff’s Department said that by 8:30 p. m. an estimated 400 people had arrived to try to “breach” the bridge and had set dozens of fires in the area. The department called the situation an “ongoing riot,” saying protesters were “very aggressive” and were trying to “flank and attack the law enforcement line. ” At least one person was arrested, the sheriff’s department said. One of the protest organizers, Dallas Goldtooth, said protesters started small fires in the area to help warm people who had been sprayed with water in the freezing cold. At least 17 protesters were injured severely enough to be taken to hospitals, Goldtooth said, according to the Associated Press. He told the Tribune that some activists tried to remove the   trucks to expose the heavily armed authorities behind them. “Folks have a right to be on a public road,” Goldtooth said. “It’s absurd that people who’ve been trying to take down the barricade now have their lives at risk. ”  Another organizer, Tara Houska, told the Tribune that more than 200 people were hit with tear gas, pepper spray or water from the hose. “They’re using everything and anything,” she said. “This has been weeks and weeks of those vehicles on the road for no apparent reason, and it’s a huge public safety risk. It’s putting enormous pressure on the Standing Rock Sioux community and people who live and work in the area. ” Organizers said the Cannon Ball gym was being used for emergency relief, with medics from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes treating people who were injured in the standoff. Physicians and tribal healers with the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council called on authorities to stop using water cannons against the protesters, saying the   weather could cause hypothermia and criticizing the “potentially lethal use of these controversial methods against people peacefully assembled,” CNN reported.

The Associated Press reported that protesters went back to the camp later in the day at the request of Standing Rock Sioux elders after reports of firearms in the crowd. The sheriff’s department said that water cannons were brought in to control the crowds and extinguish fires set by protesters. “There are multiple fires being set by protesters on the bridge and in the area of the bridge,” department spokeswoman Donnell Hushka told CNN. “We have firetrucks on the scene. They are using their fire hoses to put out the fires, wet the land around so fires don’t spread, and they are also using water as crowd control. ” The sheriff’s department told the Tribune that the bridge has been closed since October because transportation officials were concerned about its structural integrity. The $3. 8 billion pipeline is scheduled to carry crude oil nearly 1, 200 miles from North Dakota to Illinois. Construction is nearly complete, but a planned segment of the project that crosses under the Missouri River has been a source of contention for months. The Standing Rock Sioux argue that the pipeline cuts within a mile of their reservation and could pollute water and disrupt cultural sites. The tribe has challenged the project in court, and protesters have camped out near the Missouri River site for months. Energy Transfer Partners, the project developer, says the pipeline transports oil more safely than trucks and will not harm sacred lands. In October, a group of activists tried to set up a second protest camp closer to the area where drilling is planned. They blocked the roadway with scrap wood, bales of hay and tires and used abandoned trucks to block the Backwater Bridge. After repeatedly ordering them to leave, authorities stormed the camp, using pepper spray,   warnings and rubber bullets against those who refused to leave. More than 100 people were arrested.

            " ['Reconciliation Starts with Honesty and Humility'\n",
            "  'Noah Rothman’s call for reconciliation between Never Trump conservatives and   Republican voters is right in spirit, but terribly wrong in substance. I say this as a fellow Never Trump conservative: If we try to offer peace on Rothman’s terms, we will probably lose  —   and we will definitely deserve to lose.  Rothman, a columnist for Commentary magazine, goes off the rails early when he writes that “  Republicans need to remember the lesson of the ‘autopsy’ as much as do   Republicans: Electoral politics is a game of addition. ” Comprehensive immigration reform could mean any number of strategies, but, by 2012, it had become a euphemism for a series of George W. Bush —  supported policies that included   legalization for the mass of America’s unauthorized immigrants, and increased   immigration. The Gang of Eight immigration bill that emerged after the autopsy was written along those lines. We should keep in mind that this bill was not designed to get majority support. It vastly increased future immigration even though that is an incredibly unpopular policy. Only 21 percent of Americans support increasing immigration. Only 18 percent of Hispanics support increasing immigration. The bill would have primarily increased   immigration despite the preference of Republicans, Democrats, and independents for shifting future immigration flows in the direction of higher skills and  . It turned out that comprehensive immigration reform was not about addition. It was about dividing the Washington elites from the electorate, and dividing Republicans among themselves. You don’t have to be a political genius to figure out that Rothman’s implied argument  —   that Trump is collapsing because of his horrible and unstable personality, so now you have to support policies opposed by the vast majority of Americans  —   is bogus and  . This gets to another problem with Rothman’s peace terms for Trump supporters. Rothman writes: The coalition cannot be reformed around two competing ideas. Trumpism exists at odds with conservatism, and the party as reconstituted in 2017 must be one built up around conservative ideals of limited government, free trade, an internationalist foreign policy, and an unqualified rejection of identity politics. In short, Republicans of all stripes must be made to acknowledge and accept that Trumpism is an experiment that failed. That’s the price of admission, and it’s a modest one given the great costs associated with sacrificing a winnable race for the White House. Rothman is right to point out all the ways that Trump is toxic. From the beginning, Trump lacked the integrity to supervise a small town’s police force or a city’s office of the comptroller. In the case of a Trump defeat, his flaws will be obvious even to his supporters. Even the writers at the   Journal of American Greatness admitted that Trump was not the representative they would have chosen. But trying to bundle a rejection of Trumpism with a rejection of Donald Trump is coming at the problem from the wrong direction. I am probably much closer to Rothman than Trump on the vast majority of issues, but a large segment of   voters is hostile or indifferent to free trade. A large segment of   voters is ambivalent about our alliance system. If and when Trump loses, these voters will know that he didn’t lose because he questioned NAFTA, or opposed the TPP, or suggested that our allies should pay protection fees. Trump has more obtrusive weaknesses. Trump’s proposals might be wrong, but that has to be argued, and Trump’s voters need to be convinced (or at least mollified). It is no good to tell these voters that they must preemptively give up their preferences and interests because of rules that Rothman made up in his head. More Republicans Coercing CoverageTed Cruz in a Surprising New Role: Mediator, on   ReformWho Knew Governing Was This Hard? Trying to use a Trump defeat to create an artificial consensus around unpopular or divisive policies would be repeating the mistakes that led to Trump. It would mean recognizing the autopsy for what it was  —   an attempt by a minority of the party impose its own policy preferences and sensibilities on the majority  —   and then trying to do the same thing again. Some   writers have suggested that they favor a better Trumpism. I’m not one of them. I favor something better than Trumpism. I am a Mike Lee, Henry Olsen, Lawrence Mead guy. But the best way to get something better than Trumpism doesn’t start with demanding repentance from Trump supporters. It starts with the rest us explaining how we (very much including myself) messed up in the years leading up to the Trump disaster. My own confessions are forthcoming.,'\n",

Click here for a FREE subscription to Todd’s Newsletter: a   for Conservatives! The unnamed parents took offense at the words uttered by Tiny Tim, “God bless us, everyone,” television station WHTM reported. “I was very surprised because it’s going on for decades and it’s a tradition at the school that everyone looks forward to,” resident Jane Burkhart told the television station.  Like many in this deeply religious community, she was saddened by the cancelation.  Click here to join America’s favorite Conservative Facebook Community!  “One little line shouldn’t ruin it for every kid,” Burkhart said. “Charles Dickens is a class author, not a religious author. ” Principal Tom Kramer addressed the controversy in a message posted on the elementary school’s website. You can read the entire message by clicking here. “We understand that some parents are upset that the play was cancelled, but we have heard from families on both ends of the spectrum, including those who expressed appreciation that the play, as it had traditionally been prepared and delivered, was cancelled,” he wrote. Kramer went on to reject reports that their decision was based on one or two families. “That’s just not true,” he said.  He did not specifically address the parents’ allegations that the play was cancelled because of the line, “God bless us everyone. ” But he did seem to hint at some sort of issue. “Our decision is rooted in the desire to be respectful of the many cultural and religious backgrounds represented by the students attending Centerville Elementary,” he wrote.  That’s a mighty big clue, folks. In order to be tolerant and diverse, public schools have to eradicate any mention of God.  But to be fair  —   the school administration says their decision was mostly because of the amount of time it took to produce the show (about 20 hours). “Given the changes in state standards in recent years, we could not defend the commitment of this kind of instructional time to something not part of the   curriculum,” he wrote. Heaven forbid the teachers try to introduce the children to the world of the performing arts. The principal also pointed out that “producing and performing a play is not part of the written curriculum for fifth grade. ” So, after more than 40 years of Christmas productions featuring Tiny Tim and Ebenezer Scrooge, he’s just now figuring that out? Randy Wenger is the chief counsel for the Independence Law Center in Harrisburg. He’s also a longtime resident of Lancaster County. “As a constitutional attorney I hate to see traditions taken away in my own community,” he told me. “What does this communicate to our kids? It says that anything religious is really not appropriate in public life. It’s something you’re supposed to keep to yourself. ” Wenger said Lancaster County is a conservative area and has a rich history of religious liberty.  “It seems like people are trying to take aware our traditions left and right,” he said. “We need to do something to push back. ” But this year, I’m afraid Tiny Tim’s goose has been cooked by the Ghost of Christmas Intolerance.

            "  'We Are Change \\nOne day after Julian Assange officially revealed for the first time that the source of hacked Podesta and DNC emails in Wikileaks’ possession is not Russia, in the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be broadcast by RT on Saturday Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic State’s support from Washington’s Middle East allies.\\nAs previously reported, in an August 17, 2014 email made public WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to “bring pressure” on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, “which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups.”\\n“I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,” Assange, whose whistle-blowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in the interview.\\n“All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some “rogue” princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.” \\nAs recounted by RT , Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, also talked about the conflict of interest between Clinton’s official post, her husband’s nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere.\\nJohn Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia.\\nJulian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton – and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it – the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.\\nJP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation?\\nJA: Yes.\\nThe conversation then turns to the imminent presidential election: Pilger questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next week’s US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump – perhaps at Russia’s behest.\\nHowever, just as he did last week, Assange again dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is almost tied in the polls, winning as unlikely, and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate.\\n‘Trump won’t be permitted to win’ “My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment,” said Assange. “Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.”\\nJP: The accusations that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians and you hear people saying, “Well, why doesn’t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?” \\nJA: We have published over 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical. And… a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. And our documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases, refugee cases of people fleeing some kinds of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.\\nJP: Do you take yourself a view of the US election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? \\nJA: Donald Trump – what does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American “white trash,” deplorable and irredeemable. Basically, the same thing. It means, from a… establishment or educated, cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are, you know, like the rednecks, and you can’t… like, they are just… you can never deal with them. And because he so clearly – through his words and actions and the type of people that turns up at his rallies – represents the people who are not the upper-middle-class-educated, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with that, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting in any way Trump, including criticizing Clinton. And if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, it makes absolute sense.\\nHe is right, but the same was said about Brexit. \\nSources; http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/julian-assange-says-trump-wont-be-allowed-win-clinton-and-isis-are-funded-same-money \\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/365405-assange-pilger-full-transcript/ \\nFollow WE ARE CHANGE on SOCIAL MEDIA SnapChat: LukeWeAreChange \\nfbook: https://facebook.com/LukeWeAreChange \\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post Julian Assange Says Trump Won’t Be Allowed To Win, “Clinton And ISIS Are Funded By The Same Money” appeared first on We Are Change .\\n'\n",
